# _Anagrams and Antigrams_

#### _Introduction in writing Ruby scripts using basic Ruby and regular expressions, September 25, 2020_

#### By _Forrest Reiland_

## Description 

_This application prompts a user to enter two words or phrases for comparison as an anagram or antigram. After the word or phrase is input, the program uses a split method to determine whether a single word or a phrase was input. If a phrase was input, the program uses a method specific for a mult-word string. First it tests whether the input words are actually words by determining if they contain a vowel.Next it tests if they are an anagram, and then an antigram. If the input is just a single string the program follows a replicate method for a single word._
